License notes for Aetheria
-------------------------

Code (repository):
- Licensed under Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1) with Change Date 2029-02-26.

Post-change license:
- On or after the Change Date the code will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0. See [LICENSE-APACHE-2.0.txt](LICENSE-APACHE-2.0.txt#L1).

Model weights / binaries:
- Not included in this repository by default. When released they may be
  governed by a separate, more restrictive license (production/commercial
  restrictions) at the project's discretion.

Development choices and recommendations:
- BSL allows the project to keep source public while restricting production
  usage until the Change Date. This fits your requirement to keep v1 public
  but retain control.
- After the Change Date, the repository code will be covered by Apache-2.0
  (a permissive, contributor-friendly license), while model weights can be
  released under a different license if you choose.
