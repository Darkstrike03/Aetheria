The universe is not what it seems.

At least, that’s what they told me—those who saw beyond the veil. Those who glimpsed what lies beneath the surface of existence, who touched the edges of the infinite and walked away with their minds shattered, but their hearts set alight with questions.

What if everything you thought you knew about life, about death, was wrong? What if the truth is a thousand times stranger, more elusive than we dare to imagine?

I once believed that the world was simple. That what we saw was all there was. The stars, the sky, the earth below us—all governed by a set of predictable rules. But the universe doesn’t play by rules. It bends them. It breaks them.

I didn’t know it then, but I was about to learn that the world was just the beginning.

A chance encounter, a moment of fate, and suddenly the line between reality and fantasy blurred. The system, the powers, the strange force that pulses through my veins—it wasn’t supposed to happen to me. I wasn’t special. I was just... ordinary.

But ordinary lives are rarely what they seem.

A part of me was chosen to walk a path that would uncover the mysteries of the cosmos—mysteries that have been hidden from mankind for centuries. And though I didn’t understand it at the time, my life would never be the same again.

It wasn’t just the power I gained. It was the knowledge. The glimpse of something vast, something ancient, something that had always been there, just out of reach.

Now, the world as I knew it feels like a fragile dream, and I’ve only begun to wake up.

The journey has begun.

And what happens next? Well, that’s a story for later.

In the dimly lit room, the sound of a pen scratching across paper fills the air. A faint sigh echoes as the writer furiously types.

“...and that’s the intro. Perfect. At least I hope it doesn’t sound too cheesy…”

Click... click... click...

“You know, I still can’t believe you’re wasting time writing. How long are you going to keep doing this?”

The second voice comes from across the room, its owner clearly absorbed in a video game, mashing buttons in frustration.

“I’m not wasting time! I’m... well, I’m... ” The writer pauses, glancing at the screen. “I need to finish this first.”

A heavy sigh follows, and a chair scrapes against the floor as the gamer stands up and walks toward the writer.

“You’ve been saying that for hours.” the gamer teases, clearly amused. “Don’t you think everything is a little peaceful now?”

The sound of frantic footsteps as the third person enters, voice sharp with authority.

“Move. NOW.”

The door slams open. The gamer flinches at the noise.

“Do you mind? I was on a winning streak!”

“No time for your streak. The portal’s unstable and closing soon. We need to get moving. Don’t make me drag you.”

“Right. Fine, I’m coming,” the gamer grumbles, but with a smile. “You’re just jealous because I was winning.”

The writer sighs and puts the pen down, turning to the screen.

“Last time I checked, you still haven’t figured out how to finish the game without a cheat code…”

“Cheat codes are for losers,” the gamer retorts with mock indignation.

“Just move,” the third person demands, voice less patient this time. “The clock’s ticking.”

With a final, exaggerated grunt, the gamer reluctantly gets up, and the trio hurries toward the door. The sound of hurried footsteps echoes, mingling with the distant hum of something far greater than their trivial squabbles.
